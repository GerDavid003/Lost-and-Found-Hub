# Lost and Found Hub

## A web-based platform to assist students locate their lost electronic device

This is an application that helps students and faculty find their devices once they have been lost. 

### What to expect in the application

This application has:

1. Login and registration
2. Post Lost and found Items
3. View lost and found items

### The application works in the following way.

Once the user has registered or logged in, they are redirected to the dashboard. From here the user can post an item if they have lost it or post an item they have found. They can also view the posted items from the view lost and found item pages. 

The post lost items page allows the user to upload an image and provide the necessary details about their item and submit it. Once submitted they can access it through the view lost items page where only they can edit information on or delete the item.

The post found items page however does not require the user to post a found item. They can only state the name and a very mild description of the item. This is for integrity purposes so that not any random person can claim the item.

Any user who posts a lost or found item will have their credentials displayed so that they can be contacted upon claiming or retrieval of an item.
